These files are used to do some background stuff (mainly for paper, some for fixing bugs / errors we occured during the programming) and are not needed for the main program to run.

Put these back in main folder (Multimedia-Retrieval) for them to work.
but as said above most off these files don't do much, they where just there to create nice pictures or fix some files / errors we made along the way.
